            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <p>Yonker <hi>George</hi> I am heartily glad to meet with so good a friend, to whom I may safely impart my thoughts and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the ground of my sadness. I pray let me give you a glass of wine, that we may have but one half hours discourse together.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>With all my heart, <hi>Hans;</hi> and I shall give you another.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>I will tell you, <hi>George,</hi> Coming lately out of <hi>Holland,</hi> I have been much amazed to see here
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49207:3"/>so great animosities, and preparations for war against my Countrey-men, who are your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, of the same Reformed Religion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought (as I ever judged) to be closely Leagued together against our common Enemies, who, like so many Lions, watch for an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to devour us both.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed, <hi>Hans,</hi> it is the Interest of every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to fortifie themselves against their Enemies: but what if we cannot perceive a greater and more dangerous Enemy to our Nation, then your Countrey-men?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>I hope, <hi>George,</hi> you will never be able to make that appear.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, <hi>Hans,</hi> that hath sufficiently appeared to all understanding men above these fifty years; and I have oft heard old States-men say long ago, That by our great assistance, and too long fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring the <hi>Hollander</hi> against the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> we should breed up a Serpent in our bosome, that at length might devour us, and that the <hi>Hollander</hi> would be one day such a Thorn in our sides, that would hardly ever be plucked out.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>Good <hi>George,</hi> what were those great favours and assistances that we have received from the <hi>English,</hi> for I am not old enough to remember, nor am I much conversant in History.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>I will then reckon up to you some of them. First, whilst you were all Heathens, one <hi>Willibrod,</hi> a holy zealous <hi>English-man,</hi> by his great pains, and hazard of his life, first planted the Christian
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49207:3"/>Religion amongst you. Long after, when you were all overwhelmed with the Superstitions of <hi>Rome,</hi> and began to desire a Reformation, and for that were sorely persecuted by the <hi>Spanish</hi> Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, insomuch that five thousand families left their houses, and fled out of the Countrey; this our Nation received most of them, appointed Churches for them, and allowed them many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble priviledges here.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>These indeed were great Civilities, and we ought never to forget them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>I pray, <hi>Hans,</hi> do not interrupt me, for I can reckon divers more, and those very considerable. In the year 1585. when the <hi>Spaniard</hi> pressed your Countrey very sore on every side, that you began to be in a most desperate condition, <hi>England</hi> took pity upon them, took them into protection, sent over to their assistance 5000 Foot, and 1000 Horse, lent them great sums of money, obtained great aids for them from the then Prince Elector Palatine, removed the great Staple of <hi>English</hi> Cloth from <hi>Antwerp</hi> to <hi>Delft</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned the great wealth, and many fair Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings there to be seen at this day. Then the <hi>English</hi> protected your Countrey-men in their Navigation and Trade, gave them particular Licenses to Fish in the <hi>British</hi> Seas, and encouraged them every where abroad, whilst the Flower of the <hi>English</hi> Nobility and Gentry, spent their bloud, and lost their lives in your Countrey at home, in defence thereof.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:49207:4"/>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>These indeed were very signal favours, and and we should be the most unworthy wretches in the world, if we should not for ever acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them upon all occasions.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, <hi>Hans,</hi> you shall see anon how they were requited: but I have not yet done with the kindnesses multiplied by the <hi>English</hi> upon the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the enraged <hi>Spaniards</hi> saw, that by the valour and powerful assistance of the <hi>English</hi> his Forces and Moneys were most unsuccessfully wasted and consumed, he sent fifty thousand old Souldiers out of his other Dominions into <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> to devour the <hi>Hollanders</hi> at once: Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>English</hi> sent over answerable Forces, with Moneys to maintain them; for they maintained at one time, as credible Authors report, fourty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Horse and Foot there, in the service of the <hi>Ʋnited Provinces,</hi> insomuch that not long after, when we perceived plainly that you thrived and grew rich by the War, and we grew poorer every day; about the latter end of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign we began to think of withdrawing of our Forces, and demand the sums of Money which the <hi>Hollander</hi> had borrowed, with promise of paiment thereof to us in due time, which was in all above twenty hundred thousand pounds Sterling, a Debt we find not ever yet discharged: besides which mighty Sum, it was computed before the coming in of King <hi>James,</hi> that we had spent upon them in setting forth Fleets, and other Charges
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49207:4"/>for your sakes, above one Million of money, and lost in that Service there above one hundred thousand <hi>English-mens</hi> lives. King <hi>James</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward considering the Premisses, refused to assist them any longer: and not long after, observing how insolent the <hi>Hollander</hi> was grown, he issued out a Proclamation, wherein His Majesty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, That since His Majesties great Indulgence had given occasion to His Neighbours, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach upon His Regalities, to question His Right, to wrong and injure daily His Subjects in their Trade of Fishing, so as they were constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to abandon that Trade, whereby it came to pass, that divers of His Sea-towns were depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and decayed, the number of Sea-men daily diminished, which was of high consequence and importance to this Nation, considering how much the strength, and wealth, and security thereof consisteth in the power of Shipping, and use of Navigation: Therefore that his express pleasure was, That no Foreigner, of what Nation soever, should be permitted to Fish upon any of the Coasts of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and any of the Isles adjacent, without express leave first obtained of His Majesty.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding all this, your Countrey-men in a short time after grew so haughty and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, as not onely to continue their encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on our Coasts, but at length to contest with that peaceable King, and down-right to claim a Right to what they demanded, and though His
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49207:5"/>Majesty did then, by His Commissioners and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors, condescend to debate that antient Right of <hi>England</hi> with them, and conjure them not any longer to provoke him by infringing His Rights, which He and all His Ancestors had ever enjoyed without the least interruption: Yet did your Countrey-men abuse His great patience by artificial delays, pretences, shifts, dilatory ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses and evasive answers. And though they were at length brought to acknowledge the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the <hi>British</hi> Seas to be the Right of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> yet then confiding in their greatly encreased Strength at Sea, they soon after invaded this Prerogative with more insolence then before, as may be seen in the printed Letters which passed between Secretary <hi>Naunton</hi> then at <hi>White-hall,</hi> and Sir <hi>Dudley Carlton,</hi> then that Kings Ambassador at the <hi>Hague.</hi>

               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>Truly, <hi>George,</hi> if these things were so, it is a wonder, that King did not then break out into an open War with us.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>He had certainly reason enough so to do, when I have told you that which I had almost for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got. When the <hi>English</hi> had first setled a Trade in the <hi>East Indies,</hi> for some years, and setled divers Factories there, they did not refuse to permit your Countrey-men to Trade by them as much as they pleased. But those wretched people en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing in wealth, and at length perceiving their strength to be greater there then ours, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got all former Kindnesses and Friendships, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49207:5"/>began not onely to undermine us treacherously and wickedly to supplant us in our Trade there, but also utterly to exclude us out of those parts: and to that end in the year 1622. most barbarou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly seised upon the <hi>English</hi> Factories and Goods, to the value of 400000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling, tortured and murthered many of them in a more cruel and horrible manner, then ever <hi>Turks</hi> used <hi>Christians,</hi> or the <hi>Spanish Inquisition</hi> ever treated those they called <hi>Hereticks:</hi> which Inhumanity of theirs was so monstrous, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> to this very day are infamous for the same among the rude and savage <hi>Indians:</hi> And King <hi>James</hi> being truly informed thereof, told your Ambassadour at <hi>London,</hi> that he had never read nor heard of a more cruel im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious fact; but being a man of peace, he declared, that he did forgive them; but added with a kind of Prophetick spirit, <hi>[My Son's Son will revenge this bloud, and punish this horrible massacre.]</hi> Since all this, during the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr, your Countrey-men have committed many other enormities and cruelties upon the <hi>English,</hi> who endeavoured onely to continue a small Trade there, and have endamaged particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Merchants of <hi>England</hi> many hundred thousand pounds, and by engrossing all the best Spices, and selling them at their own rate, they daily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverish, not onely our Merchants, but this whole Kingdom, from whence they draw yearly for those Commodities above 400000 <hi>l.</hi> one main reason of the great want of Silver and Gold in <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>Truly, <hi>George,</hi> I cannot any longer deny but that we are much to be blamed: yet I am confident, that all this hath not so much proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of any ill-will to the <hi>English,</hi> as out of too much Love of gain.</p>

               <p>That may possibly be true in part, for it hath been observed particularly of your Nation above others, that when Gain comes in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, they do forgo not onely all Honour and Honesty, but even all Religion too.

When King <hi>Charles</hi> the First had seriously considered, how his good Subjects were used by your Countrey-men, in all parts of the World where they had power, and how bold the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> were in His Seas, Rivers, and Ports, His Majesty thought it high time to set himself to curb their insolency, and to put a stop to their most prodigious growth, and to this end took care to strengthen His Kingdom in Shipping, and to declare by Proclamation, That perceiving that all the Inconveniencies which had occasioned the forementioned Proclamation of His Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were rather increased then abated, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty did resolve thence-forward to have in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness such a power of Shipping, as might be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to hinder the like encroachments upon His Regalities, (and thereupon began to build that famous Vessel, called since <hi>The Royal Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,</hi> and some other Ships of War; for which good End, and honourable Design, he was forced by the refractoriness of a Faction in His Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49207:6"/>to lay the Tax called <hi>Ship-money.</hi>) And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause His Majesty saw, that those extraordinary preparations did occasion many jealousies and discourses abroad, he declared farther by a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Writing, That first, he held it a principle not to be denied, That the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> was a Monarch at Land and at Sea, to the full extent of His Dominions; and that it concerned Him as much to maintain His Sovereignty abroad, in all the <hi>British</hi> Seas, as at home within His Three Kingdoms, because without That, These could not be kept safe, nor He preserve His Honour and Respect with other Nations. Secondly, he held, That whosoever would endeavour to encroach on His Majesty by Sea, would doubtless do it also by Land, when ever they shall find opportunity. To avoid which, after long abused patience, His Majesty saw no other hopes, then by maintaining always a powerful Navy. Thirdly, it was very notorious, how of latter years His Majesties Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion at Sea hath been disobeyed and questioned. That at first to cherish the poor distressed <hi>Dutch,</hi> leave was given them to gather strength and wealth upon these Coasts, in these Ports, and by the <hi>English</hi> Trade and People: That upon their humble Petitions, Licenses were given them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Great Seal of <hi>England</hi> to Fish upon these Coasts; and when by leave or connivance they had for some time Fished upon all the Coasts of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and by the <hi>English</hi> Staple of Woollen Clothes brought from the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49207:7"/>Netherlands,</hi> and setled in their Towns, they arrived to an extraordinary power in Shipping, they refused at first to be kept at any distance from these Coasts: After that, they began to keep Ship-guards on these Seas, to prohibit even the <hi>English</hi> to have free Commerce there, to seize on their Ships and Goods, if they refused to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to their Placaets; to interrupt the Trade and Traffick of these Seas by Ships of War and Free-booters, to presume at all times to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all His Majesties Ports and Rivers, to come up as high as the Chief City, to cast Anchor close to our Magazines, to contemn His Majesties Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers when they required a farther distance, to assault and take the Ships of His Majesties Allies, even within His own Chamber or Channel, and within his Rivers, to the scorn and contempt of His Majesties Dominion and Power. That this their ordinary practises, His Majesty having in vain endeavoured for divers years, by Treaties, to reform, he thought it high time to put himself in this Equipage, both for His own defence and safety, for preserving His antient and undoubted Right in the Dominion of these Seas; to suffer no other Prince or Potentate to encroach upon His Regalities, but to constrain them to perform due Homage to His Admirals and Ships, to pay them Acknowledgments as in former times they all had done; to set open these Seas, and therein to protect a free Trade of all His Subjects, and also of all His Allies, and to give them such safe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49207:7"/>Conduct and Convoy, as they shall reasonably require: To suffer no Fleets or Ships of War of other Nations, to keep any Guards upon these Seas, to take any Prizes or Booties, to offer any violence, or give any interruption to any lawful intercourse. In a word, That His Majesty was resolved to do Justice, both to His Subjects and Friends, within the Limits of these Seas; and that this was the Real and Royal Design of that Fleet.</p>

               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>Certainly, <hi>George,</hi> that King was a very good Man, and would not declare publickly any untruth; if so, then he had great reason to make such extraordinary Preparations: but I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what became thereof.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>Not long after began those unhappy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, first in <hi>Scotland,</hi> then in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and lastly in <hi>England,</hi> which gave a long check to our happiness, and to this design. And in the mean time your Countrey-men very cunningly, bought up much of our best <hi>English</hi> Oak, (which for Shipping is the best in the world) cut down by our wicked Rebels, and sold to you at very low Rates; and you then encreased so prodigiously in Naval power, that even those Rebels began at length to see, that the main and principal Interest of <hi>England</hi> was to stop the growth of the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander;</hi> and therefore took occasion in the year 1652. to make a rupture, and to prosecute it so far, that they had almost done their work: But that Design was then broken in the midst by <hi>Oliver
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49207:8"/>Cromwel,</hi> who dissolving the remainder of the long factious Parliament, and usurping all the power of the Nation, thought it his own private Interest for a good sum of Money to clap up a peace with your Countrey-men, at a juncture of time, when it lay in his power in all humane pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, to have done the highest piece of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for this Nation that could possibly have been effected, (except onely the Restoration of our present Sovereign, whom God long preserve) for he might then have humbled your Nation to that degree, that they should have been glad of the Protection of <hi>England,</hi> and so from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward have lived in great Amity and Peace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and not onely our Trade would for ever have flourished, but thereby had been prevented the vast Expences of Treasure and Bloud, which our two last Wars have since occasioned, to the great Impoverishment and Damage of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>But to go on. Within two or three years after that first rupture with your Countrey-men, they having set themselves to build new Ships, and increase their Naval strength, began again to supplant the <hi>English</hi> Trade in several parts, and resolving to fright them quite out of that small Trade the <hi>English</hi> retained in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> the <hi>Hollander</hi> grew so insolent, as not onely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the <hi>English</hi> all Trade at <hi>Bantam,</hi> where they had a Factory, but seizing on their Ships and Goods, most cruelly and barbarously treated the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49207:8"/>Sea-men, torturing some, and murdering others: for which, to prevent another rupture, the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> were content to pay to our <hi>English East-India</hi> Merchants 50000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling, in the year 1658. at <hi>Amsterdam.</hi> About two years after, you know was the most happy Restauration of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, who having received at the <hi>Hague</hi> divers respects and civilities for several days, before he took Shipping for <hi>England,</hi> was afterwards very unwilling to break Friendship with them, till their Insolencies and Injuries cried so loud for vengeance, (as may be seen in the Memorials presented by His Majesties Envoy to the <hi>States General</hi> at the <hi>Hague</hi>) that there was no other Expedient left but another Rupture, which happened in the year 1665. when the <hi>Dutch</hi> were grown much more powerful at Sea (by the addition of many new-built mighty Ships) then they were in the former Rupture, and much more unanimous at home: yet we had then, especially after the first Fight, good reason to hope, that we should have not onely abated the pride, and stopt the growth of your Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but also have weakened and humbled them, so far as that they should never have risen up again to be a Thorn in our sides. But their time was not yet come, their sins were not then ripe; and therefore it pleased the Sovereign Disposer of all things, by a most sore Pestilence, and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dismal Fire, at that time to put a stop to our Victories and Successes. Whereupon a Peace was
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49207:9"/>concluded at <hi>Breda,</hi> in the year 1667. Since which, they have built so many, and so great new Ships of War, that confiding in their exorbitant power, they have not onely ventured again to supplant our Trade, (the want whereof causeth so great murmuring in <hi>England</hi>) but also to break all the Articles of the <hi>Breda</hi> Treaty, and utterly deny His Majesties Sovereignty over these Seas, and to threaten us to joyn with the <hi>French,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade our Countrey, and swallow us up for ever. Whereupon His Majesty, having first made sure of His Allies abroad, and carefully provided at a most vast expence, not onely such a formidable Fleet, such great Stores of Ammunition, such a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of brave Seamen, but also such a Full Treasury, as none of His Ancestors ever were Masters of, thought himself obliged again to declare War against the <hi>Ʋnited Netherlands,</hi> this present year 1672. not onely to chastize them for their breach of Faith and Articles, and for their most scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Libels, insolent and unmannerly Pictures, Verses, and Representations of our King and Princes. (which should make the bloud of every loyal, true-hearted, well-born <hi>English-man</hi> even to rise against them) but also to establish and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment our Trade both at home and abroad; and above all, to maintain the Antient Sovereign Right and Dominion over the Narrow Seas, which is one of the first Prerogatives of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Kings, and should be the last wherewith they should ever part; for without that, what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49207:9"/>will it be for <hi>England</hi> to be an Island? and how will it be more secure from Invasions, then any. Countrey upon the Continent? and how easily would our Trade and Traffick be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from us? Wherefore considering that the Sovereignty of the Seas is the most precious Jewel in His Majesties Crown, that to touch that is to touch the Apple of <hi>England</hi>'s Eye; that it is next, under God, the principal means of our wealth and safety; and that it hath lately most injuriously been invaded by the <hi>Dutch;</hi> all true <hi>English</hi> Hearts and Hands seem to stand obliged by all lawful ways and means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve and maintain the same, with the utmost hazard of their Lives and Fortunes, with a cheerful Expence of their Bloud and their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, with a resolution never to lay down Arms, until they have accomplished this great and good Work.</p>

               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, <hi>Hans,</hi> that may easily be done; for no King, Prince, or Potentate in the world doth tyrannize less then he doth, or ever hath done since he came to this Crown.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>What means then this Bleating of Sheep
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49207:10"/>in mine ears, and this Lowing of Oxen which I hear? what means so much murmuring and grumbling in many places against the King and His Court?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>I will tell you, <hi>Hans,</hi> There has been grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at Kings and Courts, before you and I were born, and will be so when we are dead and votten. It is the nature of the Beast, (the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people) to be perpetually complaining of the Times, and of the Government. But beside; Here is a sort of ill-natur'd and ill-nurtur'd peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in this Nation, who would speak evil of, and despise even the Son of God himself, if he should be sent to Rule over this Kingdom.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>But in good earnest, <hi>George,</hi> do you not think that the <hi>English</hi> have just cause to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, when they part with such vast Sums of Money?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>Truly no. But I pray how much Money do you think His Majesty had of us towards the setting forth of this Fleet, the biggest and the best provided that ever <hi>England</hi> saw?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>Much more then our Superiours had of us for their Fleet, which is little inferiour to yours.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>How much I prethee was that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>About twenty Millions of Guilders, which amounts to about Eighteen hundred thousand pounds Sterling.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>Very good; And His Majesty of <hi>England</hi> sets out this Fleet upon His own proper Charge and Credit.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:49207:10"/>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>But then I suppose in the mean time it must needs be, that the Ordinary Taxes, the Gabels and the Imposts upon all sorts of Commodities in <hi>England</hi> are much heavier then ours.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>How heavy is that, <hi>Hans?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>So heavy, that to mention onely in a few. We pay for Houses yearly the eighth part of the Rent; for Lands, above a third part of the Rent; for all Beer, where we pay the Brewer six Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, we pay five Guilders more to the State, and yet the Brewer pays Excise for his Malt besides; and no Subject, great or small, in City or Village, is allowed to Brew any Beer, but is constrained to take it all of the Common Brewer. Then for Wine, All the better sort of people pay a large Excise for two or three Hogsheads, or more, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their quality, whether they buy or drink any Wine or not. Then we have a grievous Excise upon Fire, Candles, Salt, Bread, all sorts of Flesh, and indeed almost upon every thing that is necessary or expedient for the use of man: So that counting all, especially at this time since the War begun with <hi>England,</hi> he that hath a hundred pounds coming in by Lands, Houses, or Trade, pays to the State at least 25 <hi>l.</hi> by the year.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>Truly, <hi>Hans,</hi> this you say amazes me; for I thought you had been a free Common-wealth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>So we are.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>Wherein consists that freedom?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>We are free of our Tongues, we can call our Governours, our Burgomasters, <hi>Skelm;</hi> and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49207:11"/>our States-men, <hi>Hunsfoot;</hi> and talk Treason without any punishment.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>But I thought that since you did with the loss of so much Bloud and Treasure, withdraw your necks from under the yoke of a Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or Kingly Government, and changed your State into a Common-wealth, you had been more free from Taxes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>No such matter, <hi>George;</hi> for one Stiver we paid when we lived under a King, we pay at least fifteen Stivers now. But I pray, <hi>George,</hi> answer me to my former question: Are not your Taxes now very grievous in <hi>England?</hi> for I remember that when the Rump Parliament (which we cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led then <hi>de Englische Stert Vergadering</hi>) made War against <hi>Holland,</hi> here was a Tax (for I was then in <hi>England</hi>) of Sixscore thousand pounds a moneth, for a long time; besides they had before taken into their hands all the lands of the Crown, of the Church, and of many Nobles who adhered to their King.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>Truly, <hi>Hans,</hi> whatever was done then, we have now so few Taxes, and those so little grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, that I can scarce tell whether we have any Tax at all; unless it be a moderate Excise of Drinks, and onely such Drinks as are bought and sold. Yes, now I remember one more, that some murmur against, and that is (as you have in <hi>Holland</hi>) a Tax upon Dwelling-houses; but as you pay every year the Eighth part of the yearly Rent to the State, we pay but the Fourtieth part,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49207:11"/>or thereabouts, to our King: and we call it <hi>Hearth-money,</hi> or <hi>Chimney-money.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>O Heer, Godt then doth <hi>England</hi> swarm at this time with a Race of Jews!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>Why so, <hi>Hans,</hi> what extravagant conceit is that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>They must needs be of the Race of the Jews, who being in such a happy condition above all the Subjects in Christendome, yet every where (and more especially in <hi>London</hi>) I can hear murmuring continually against your <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> against your King and Bishops.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>Good <hi>Hans,</hi> what is it that you hear them say against our King? God bless him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>Marry they say, That this Parliament hath given to this King more money, then any of His Ancestors ever had in five times that space, and they know not what becomes of it all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>I shall easily grant that His Majesty hath had great sums of Money since His Restauration; yet not so great, but that if we seriously consider, the great Debts which <hi>Cromwell</hi> left due to the Army and Navy; His Majesties own Debts contracted by Himself and Brothers beyond the Seas, by our fault, in driving them out of their own Land: then the building of so many and so great Ships of War, almost every year since His Restauration; the Storing of all His huge Magazines with Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition for all His land and Naval Forces; the maintaining of so many Garrisons upon all the Coasts of <hi>England;</hi> of so many great Guards of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49207:12"/>Horse and Foot at <hi>London:</hi> but above all, the waging of War some years against Three Potent Enemies, the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the <hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>Dane.</hi> If we seriously consider these things, we must ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther admire how His Majesty could effect so great things with so little money: For I have been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry credibly informed, that, during the late Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, one years war between the <hi>English</hi> and the <hi>Hollander</hi> cost the <hi>English</hi> (who were then esteemed very frugal) above seventeen hundred thousand pounds; and yet their Ships and Fleets were not then near so great as now.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed, <hi>George,</hi> I am of your mind in that point, and rather admire what becomes of all the Moneys, which the <hi>Ʋnited Provinces</hi> squeeze every year out of their Subjects, which is almost Twenty times as much as ever our Ancestors paid, and almost Six times the setled yearly Revenue of your King; for our Revenue amounts (as I am assured) to seven Millions of pounds Sterling.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>But I pray, <hi>Hans,</hi> what more have you heard of our King? Can any of those Fanatick Grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers, or Murmuring Jews, truly say, That du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any twelve years since the Conquest, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject hath had less oppression, less injustice from their Sovereign, or more Clemency, and greater Condescensions? hath he ever denied His People in Parliament one reasonable request? Is not the Law open and Free to protect impartially even the worst of His Enemies now living, and the worst of Schismaticks, against the most Loyal and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49207:12"/>most Orthodox of this Kingdom, which is rather admired, then ever imitated by other Nations? Doth not every man at present eat of his own Vine, and of his own Fig-tree, and drink the waters of his own Cistern? doth not <hi>Israel,</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> too, sit securely every one under his own Vine, whereas heretofore the factious sacrilegious Rebels, and plundering Robbers, did sit under the Vines, and eat of the Grapes, which did unquestionably belong to the Loyal Honest Nobility and Gentry, to the Orthodox, Learned, Pious Clergy, to God and His Holy Church.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>But dost thou think, <hi>George,</hi> that His Majesty takes a true measure of the Interest of His People, especially in this War?</p>
            </sp>

               <p>If thou wilt have my opinion, <hi>Hans,</hi> I do believe, that no Prince understands his Interest better, and that he shews it particularly in this very War. Tell me, <hi>Hans,</hi> and confess ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously; do not you think that the grand Interest of <hi>England</hi> is to maintain Trade, and in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, to maintain the Empire of the <hi>British</hi> Seas against all Encroachers whatsoever?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>It is not fit for me that am a <hi>Hollander</hi> to speak to that point, but I know what I think.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>Well, did ever any King of <hi>England</hi> mind more that Interest, then our present Sovereign, whose Royal Father and Grandfather were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed very worthy Princes, and ought in their times to have set about this work which is now in hand. Did ever any King make it more his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49207:13"/>business to inform himself touching Maritime Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; nay, I have been assured, that there is searce a Sea-man in this Nation, that understands better the Building, the Rigging, the Victualling, the Charges, and the very Sailing of a Ship, then His Majesty of <hi>England,</hi> that understands better the Timber and Materials for Shipping, that can make better choice of Ship-carpenters; that no King in Christendom ever favoured so much the most ingenious persons of that most useful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, that can make better choice of a Sea-man, that none ever so much valued, cherished, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged Mariners, that ever so well understood all our Coasts, Seas, Flats, Sholes, Sands; and above all, the best way of fighting at Sea.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>Truly, as the case now stands, it is hard to wish for a better Prince in that respect for you, and a worse for us: and yet I am confident, if a lasting Peace were once concluded between us, He would be our best Friend in the world, and if need were, would protect us, as His Ancestors have ever done, against all others that should ever attempt to wrong us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>Besides, <hi>Hans,</hi> do but consider how he hath thought nothing too much to promote this Grand Interest, His Majesty hath not spared the apparent hazarding of the Life of His onely Brother the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> at Sea.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>And in good faith, <hi>George,</hi> he hath hazarded it with a witness now; for the Wind and Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther favouring us this last Summer, we had him in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49207:13"/>the midst of ten or twelve of our principal Ships, at such an unexpected advantage, that it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most a miracle he should escape our hands.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed, <hi>Hans,</hi> as I have been certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, His Royal Highness did in the last En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement behave himself with that Activeness and Conduct, with that Courage and Undaunted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, when he was sore pressed on every side, his Ship torn, and many of his best friends about him slain, and hath since endured many storms, and great hardship, with such patience, for the service of our King and Countrey, that no Prince of the Bloud since the Conquest hath better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to be brought home with triumph, and received by this City with all expressions of joy and gratitude.</p>
               <p>But moreover, <hi>Hans,</hi> (to go on where we left) His Majesty hath not spared to hazard the Person and Life of His dearly beloved Son, his Grace the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> together with many of His choice and most valiant Nobility and Gentry. Also to promote this grand Design of preserving the just Right and Dominion of the Sea, and to recover, and thereby advance the Trade of His Subjects. That He might the better provide for His Shipping and Sea-men, His Majesty hath been pleased to save even as it were out of His own belly, and out of the bellies of all His Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick Servants, by a great and long retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of His Court-tables, &amp;c.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, good Yonker <hi>George,</hi> say no more; I
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49207:14"/>perceive well enough, that <hi>Benefacere &amp; malé audire Regium est.</hi> It is too oft the fate of Kings (witness the last good King) to be very ill spoken of when they do best for their Subjects good. I marvel what it is, that this ill-natured people would have? When they had long abused, and at length murthered the best King, if not the best Man then in the world, and for that cause might very reasonably have expected, that God should have sent them next the worst of Tyrants, or some Usurper, some Heretical or Infidel King, to oppress them, and scourge them to death with Whips and Scorpions, as they well deserved; that God should even then be so gracious, as to send them their own King, the true undoubted Heir of the Crown of <hi>England:</hi> Sure if they were not an ungrateful people, they should be ever praising God for so unspeakable a benefit.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>Nay more, <hi>Hans,</hi> God hath not onely sent us our own King, but one that in His long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence abroad, amongst those of the <hi>Romish</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, was never tainted with any of their Errours, but at His first Restauration, made it His first work to restore (like another good King <hi>Hezekiah</hi>) Gods true Religion, the Rights and Revenues of the Church, the Priests and Levites, &amp;c.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>But, <hi>George,</hi> there is one or two things more, whereat many <hi>English</hi> of my acquaintance oft grumble, to answer which, I would be glad to be able; and that is, They cry there is less Trade, and less Money in the Nation, and more Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49207:14"/>Libertinism, Incontinence, Intemperance, Debauchery, Irreligion, and Atheism, and a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter growth of Popery, then ever was; and that generally <hi>England</hi> is in a less flourishing condition then heretofore.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>Sure, <hi>Hans,</hi> you have had ill luck to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to very bad company since you came into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> I know very well, that we have too many <hi>English,</hi> who are largely endowed with all those qualifications of the antient <hi>Jews,</hi> whereof the Almighty so oft complained. I know here are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, who are not onely stubborn and stiff-necked, as those <hi>Jews</hi> were, but at that very time when God is leading them into the Land of Promise, (into Peace and Plenty) they are ever and anon murmuring and complaining, wishing themselves back into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and whining after their Leeks and Onions there (<hi>Numb.</hi> 11.5.) wishing for our former Arbitrary Tyrannical Government, under most disloyal treacherous Usurpers and Traitours. As for the first complaint, of less Trade and less Money, it is apparent by His Majesties Customs, lately Farmed at a higher rate then ever, that the Trade in general cannot be much diminished: then it must be considered, that during the late wicked Rebellion, more Youths of all conditions being then put to Trades, for want of other em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, it is now come to pass, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing set up, the Kingdom is much overstockt with Traders; all sorts of Trades are now divided into so many hands, that none of them can gain as
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49207:15"/>heretofore, and few of them are able to live one by another. Lastly, it is no wonder that our Trade should be somewhat lessened, when the <hi>Hollanders</hi> make it their main business, by Lies and Cheats, most treacherously and ungratefully, as afore mentioned, to supplant all our Foreign Trade; which to prevent, our present Sovereign ever since His Restoration hath made it His main business (by still augmenting His Naval Power) and is now, God be blessed, almost arrived at His wished Port. As for the other point, that we have less Money, we may also thank the <hi>Hollanders</hi> for the same; for it is well known, that they having most unjustly taken from us the <hi>Spicy Islands</hi> in the <hi>East-Indies</hi> (one of which <hi>(Poleroon)</hi> they have by four several Treaties solemnly promised to restore, and yet is not done to this day) we are forced, as aforesaid, to part with 400000 <hi>l.</hi> a year for Spices, and so proportionably for other Commodities. As for Loosness, Intemperance, Debauchery, Incontinence, Irreligion, Atheism, and Popery; if there be more thereof then heretofore, where must justly lie all the blame, but even at the doors of those very Murmurers, and their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors, who first disturbed, and then over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the best govern'd State and Church in the world, letting in all sorts of Religions, which all wise men then foresaw would end at length in Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion, Popery, and Atheism, from whence must needs follow all Looseness and Debauchery. And indeed, the Issue and Consequence of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49207:15"/>that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that Plurality of Religions in this Kingdom, at first countenanced by the factious part of the Long Parliament, was by many sober pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent men then foretold to be either Popery, or else Irreligion, Prophaneness, and Atheism. And I remember that St. <hi>William</hi> (I mean the holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr Archbishop <hi>Laud,</hi> who being murthered on the day of St. <hi>William</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Bourges</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> which was the tenth of <hi>January,</hi> seems to claim a place in our <hi>English</hi> Kalendar) upon the Scaffold told us, who were then sorrowful Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators of his Martyrdom, That the Pope never since the Reformation had so great a Harvest in <hi>England,</hi> as by the many Sects and Religions then introduced: And indeed, when that excellent Person, together with the High Commission Court, those two principal Bulwarks against Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, Heresies, Schisms, and all Licentiousness, were thrown down by the then prevailing <hi>Prsby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian,</hi> no wonder if those Enormities have ever since encreased amongst us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>But I hear some say farther, That this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom doth not flourish as heretofore, the times are now harder, and the Subject in a worse condition then formerly.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>I remember, <hi>Hans,</hi> to have read and observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Histories of <hi>England,</hi> amongst other things, that throughout all the most happy Reigns of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> and the first part of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr, there were a sort of people that were known by the name of <hi>Grumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:49207:16"/>who in stead of praising God for His great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances, and abundant blessings, would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways murmuring against the Times; a People that through the gall and bitterness of their own hearts, did so far lose their Tastes and Judgments, that their whole practise was to deprive God of His Glory, the Prince of His Honour, and the People of their Senses; affirming that the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>England</hi> was very miserable, and full of the Tokens of Gods wrath and indignation; when the whole Nation was happy even to the envy of Christendome. And no wonder if you meet with some of that ill conditioned Race at this day. I confess that I have met with some, who having heard or read of the causeless complaints made by factious spirits, and discontented people against the last King, do now begin to tread the same steps, railing against the Kings Court, slandering the Government and Governours, like railing <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheka's,</hi> and foul-mouth'd <hi>Shimeis:</hi> They are zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in procuring a Divorce between their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and His Subjects hearts and affections; whereas true Christianity, and true Allegiance, doth instruct and oblige every Subject to be more careful of His Sovereigns Credit and Honour, then of his own, and with the two modest sons of Noah, no sooner to know then to hide their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers nakedness. It is very true, <hi>Hans,</hi> that there is no Government on earth perfect, nor are Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours without humane infirmities; and there is no time but it hath something more laudable, then
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49207:16"/>the foregoing or succeeding times. But if any one will seriously reflect on the whole Twelve years Reign of our Dread Sovereign now Reigning. I dare affirm, (without the least flattery) that he shall hardly find in the like space of time, in any other Princes Reign, either at home or abroad, so great plenty and abundance of all things, for the use or delight of mankind, so vast an encrease of Buildings, so many stately Palaces, fair Churches, mighty Ships of War; so great improvement of Lands in all places, both Arable and Pasture; so many Plantations of Trees, both for Fruit and Timber; Parks and Forrests new stored with the best Venison in the world; mighty Plantations abroad, new Inventions and Handy-crafts, indeed all Arts and Sciences, improved at home; old Inventions daily bettered, Rivers made Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, new Fortresses and Havens, both at home and and abroad, and those made far more commodious by mighty Moles and Piers. Moreover he shall hardly find so long a time so free from Injustice, or from Oppression, where King and Nobles have less oppressed the Commons, where there hath been so great Condescensions and Indulgences to tender Consciences: and if it be true, that as <hi>multa funera sunt opprobria Medicorum,</hi> so <hi>multa supplicia sunt opprobria Principum.</hi> It will be much for the Honour of His Majesty, and His twelve years Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that here have not been one Nobleman put to death, and so few of others at all the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sizes in this Kingdom, that the like was never
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49207:17"/>known in the memory of any man living; and yet such impartial Justice every where, that we have fewer Robberies, Murders, Duels, then ever. Besides all this, there is nothing more true, that since His Majesties Restauration, all people generally over all <hi>England,</hi> both in Cities, Towns, and Villages, dwell in fairer Houses, those Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are more richly furnished; Men and Women are more costly clothed, eat and drink bettter, then any of their forefathers of the same quality and condition, and perhaps then any other Nation at this day under the Sun.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>Good <hi>George,</hi> proceed no farther; your peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would be too happy, if they knew their own happiness.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>But prethee, <hi>Hans,</hi> what dost thou hear our Nonconformists, and such Malecontents, say of our Bishops; for you told me they murmured against <hi>Aaron</hi> as well as <hi>Moses.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>Not much, <hi>George,</hi> but somewhat heavy; for they say, your Bishops, and other Dignified Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, are Idle and Idol-shepherds; that they are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, dumb Dogs, &amp;c.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>This is a heavy charge indeed, but do you believe any of this to be true?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>Truly very little, for I have had the honour to be acquainted with divers of them, and I have always found them well employed about their Charge; so free from Idolatry, that to an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Judge, who hath seen other Reformed Churches abroad, there is scarce any Church in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49207:17"/>Christendome, but gives as much occasion of scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal that way: Then as for Covetousness, I can say so much, that all those whom I know, do keep so good Hospitality, are so charitable to the Poor, that I am confident, very few of them will be able to leave to their Children or Relations so much as one of the meanest Lawyers, Merchants, or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of this Kingdom: But as to that charge of Dumb Dogs, I know not well what to say; for I think they preach but seldom, and therefore seem not to deserve so much means.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>Truly, <hi>Hans,</hi> I was once of that mind too, till I well considered, First, That it is not now amongst us, as it was in the Primitive times; for those <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> lived in the midst of <hi>Jews, Heathens,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels</hi> to whom it was necessary, that the Gospel, or glad Tidings of Christs being come in the Flesh to redeem the world (which is properly the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel) should upon all occasions be proclaimed (for that is properly preaching the Gospel, and not our manner of making of Harangues in a Pulpit) in all places amongst the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That there were then but a small num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Learned Divines, who were well able to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue the case, and convince Unbelievers of this Truth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The number of Souls under each Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop were not then so many, but that a Bishop might with ease both Govern and Teach the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That now the number of Teachers, and the several Congregations and Churches
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49207:18"/>under the Bishops care, are so many, that it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come enough to be the Task-master, to have one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a due care, that the Inferiour Clergy duly Preach, and perform rightly their duties in their several Congregations.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>But then is it not unreasonable, that those who seem to sit still, should have so much means, and those that sweat and bear the heat of the day, I mean those that Preach, should have so little?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>Why you have been at Sea, <hi>Hans,</hi> where you have seen many Sea-men pull at the Ropes, hazard their lives in triming the Ship, sweat and take great pains; whilst the long-experienced so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber wise Pilot sits still at the Helm, considering the Ships Course, comparing that with the Winds and Tides, with the Season of the Year; the Flats and Shelves, the Sands and Rocks, the Pirates and Enemies, &amp;c. without whose constant Conduct (notwithstanding all the others toil and pains) the Ship would not be safe perhaps one hour: Will you now say, that it is unreasonable, that this man should have a better Salary, then any of those other labouring Mariners?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>Truly, <hi>George,</hi> your <hi>Simile</hi> is so apposite, that I shall never more give ear to these barking Curs; but on the contrary shall love and honour those whom they so undutifully and impiously style <hi>Dumb Dogs.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>Besides, all wise men know, that as it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous for a Pilot to quit the Helm, and pull at the Ropes, so it hath been oft seen, that where a Bishop of a large Diocess hath been very
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49207:18"/>Bookish, and oft in the Pulpit, that Diocess hath most usually been worst governed.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Hans,</hi> what should we trouble our selves longer upon this subject; for I have observed, that in all this Kingdom, there are scarce any, but either some ill-natur'd and ill-nurtur'd Gentry, or else some half-learned or half-witted Commonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who will open their mouths against our Bishops or Clergy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>But, <hi>George,</hi> here's a War begun, you say, upon your Kings Credit: but where's the Money to carry it on?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>You do not consider, <hi>Hans,</hi> that it is the Peoples War as well as the King, and they'l never want money to preserve themselves. Can you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that when the Parliament comes together again, they will not immediately take His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Supply into consideration. A Prince who by His infinite care of the grand Interest of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which I told you before is the Dominion of the Sea) hath so far obliged all His Subjects, as His majesty hath done above and beyond His Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, who ought to have undertaken this work, of stopping the prodigious growth of the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> in their Reigns, when it was far more feasible.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>But I hear some say, It is almost impossible to raise such a Sum at this time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>Good <hi>Hans,</hi> you will say these men are very short-sighted that tell you so, when I shall have shewed you, how above two millions yearly may easily be raised in <hi>England,</hi> without ever grieving the people; which is a piece of Policy that I learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49207:19"/>in your Countrey, when I lived there.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>I pray how is that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>Not by Land-tax, or House-tax, or Hearth-money, or Poll-money, or by any other way where Money is taken from the People in the Lump, for that is ever very grievous unto them, as an old wise States-man in <hi>Holland</hi> once told me, that they had several times found by woful experience.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>How then?</p>
            </sp>

               <p>In good faith onely by small Excises, and that first upon such Commodities that naturally oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion Excess, Luxury, Pride, Wantonness, Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or corruption of Manners; as upon Wines, and all strong Drinks; upon Sugars, Spices, Sauces, Raisins, Currans, and all sorts of Sweet meats; then upon all sorts of Laces, Ribbons, Silks, and fine Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen; upon Cards, Dice, Tables; upon Coaches, Sedans; upon all sorts of Jewels, Fans, Feathers, Perywigs, Pictures, Looking-glasses, Plate, and Hangings. And in case such as these will not raise enough, then to lay a small Excise upon some few of those Commodities, that are most generally and most constantly used; as upon all Butchers meat, Bread, Butter, Cheese, Salt, Candles, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>O Heer, have you all these Commodities Unexcised, and suffer your King to want money? when as almost all the Kingdoms and States in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> have Excised all of them, and as many more; when as in our Seven Provinces, which have not half so many people as <hi>England,</hi> we have for many years raised above Sixteen hundred thousand pound Sterling out of those Commodities, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49207:19"/>yet no man complains, but all grow rich.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>I pray, <hi>Hans,</hi> do me the favour to inform me, by what Rules you lay your Excises there: for I know, that in the late long Wars with <hi>Spain,</hi> you were put to all the shifts imaginable of raising Moneys the most commodest and best way.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>It is very true, <hi>George;</hi> and I remember, that once we were so put to our shifts, that having laid so high an Excise as would be born upon all sorts of Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, that were to be bought and sold, which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve are almost 200. we yet wanted money to carry on the War against the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who then pressed us sore; whereupon our <hi>Lords States General</hi> proposed a very considerable sum of money to any one who could invent a way to raise a considerable Standing Revenue, without grieving the people; and an honest Minister of <hi>Harlem</hi> thereupon invented (by a kind of inspiration I think) that admirable Tax of Sealed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which our Adversary soon made use of in <hi>Spain,</hi> and since many other Countreys have done the like; the manner of which Tax I shall relate to you at some other time, and will now tell you by what Rules we lay our Excises.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>That was the thing I chiefly desired.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>You must know then, that as Excises are the most equal, and less grievous Tax of all other, so the main rule in raising them is, that you may charge any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity so high, as you do no way hinder the consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of that Commodity: as for example, Who would ever use the less Sugar, if one peny Excise were paid out of 12 peniworth? Who would use the fewer Ribbons, for 2 <hi>d.</hi> Excise upon every 12 <hi>d?</hi> Who would
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49207:20"/>play the less at Cards or Dice, if 3 <hi>d.</hi> were paid out of 12 <hi>d?</hi> What Lady would ever forbear to wear Pearls or Diamonds, or to buy Fans and Looking-glasses, if 4 <hi>d.</hi> were laid upon every 12 <hi>d?</hi> Who would forbear to keep a Coach for 5 <hi>l.</hi> Excise <hi>per annum?</hi> So if there were 6 <hi>d.</hi> upon every ounce of Plate, who would use the less in his house?</p>
               <p>Now if these and such like Excises will not serve to discharge the publick Debts and Expences of the Crown, without an Excise upon those other more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Commodities, as Flesh, Butter, and Cheese, &amp;c. who would spend the less of them in his house, if there were laid upon every pound but a half peny, or upon a pound of Candles a peny.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>But then, <hi>Hans,</hi> me-thinks that will not raise any considerable sum.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>You cannot at first sight imagine what great sums they would raise. I remember, once taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice by chance of the great number of Candles, burnt in the Shops and Houses of this your City and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs of <hi>London,</hi> I with some other informed our selves of the number of Families, and at length found, that one peny Excise upon a pound of Candles, would amount to at least eighty thousand pounds in a year; and yet your Chandlers are suffered sometimes to raise their prizes as much at their own pleasure, and no man regards it. So likewise your Cole-mongers are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to raise their Coals, sometimes 10 <hi>s.</hi> in a Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron at their own pleasure; and others to raise Soap a peny in the pound, &amp;c. Will any one then grudge so much to be taxed upon any of those Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities towards the publick Charges of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome?
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49207:20"/>Certainly he must be a malignant ill-natur'd Subject that will do it. But I know a better way then all these, in my opinion, to raise a very considerable sum of money, and even pleasure the people thereby.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>In good faith, <hi>Hans,</hi> you might thereby much oblige our King and all His People; especially at this time, when there is so great need of money to pay publick Debts, and to defray the vast Charges of our Naval and Land Forces, of our many Garrisons, Guards, &amp;c. Charges far above and beyond any that His Majesties Predecessors ever knew.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>The way then briefly is this, We have found by long experience in <hi>Holland,</hi> that to suffer no man to brew his own Beer, hath this great benefit, that every man may drink better and cheaper then he could possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly do, if he brewed it himself. And I have been cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly informed, that not onely the <hi>Londoners,</hi> but also most of the Villages within ten or twenty miles of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> now choose rather to buy their Beer of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Brewers thereabouts, and pay Excise, then to trouble themselves to brew at home, though then it should be free from all Excise. Now if there were an Act of Parliament for setting up Brew-houses in all or most of the Market-Towns of <hi>England,</hi> and that no place within a mile or two of those Market-Towns should be suffered to Brew their own Beer, but to take it of those Brewers, as all our <hi>Dorps</hi> do in <hi>Holland;</hi> the ordinary Excise upon all that Beer brewed then by those publick Brewers, would by computation amount to near 300000 <hi>l.</hi> a year, more then what the Excise of Beer and Ale now comes to in <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>I would to God, <hi>Hans,</hi> you were able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49207:21"/>our Parliament-men of the commodiousness of Excises, it might be much more happy for King and People then other Taxes; as the last Subsidy, where the People were discontented in paying but so much in the Lump, and the King had reason to be more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented that many paid not one moiety of what they ought to have paid. But one thing more, <hi>Hans,</hi> I would gladly learn of you, and that is, The right way of Collecting Excises, that the Subjects may not be much disturbed and abused, and yet the King not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded of His Due.</p>

               <p>O Yonker <hi>George,</hi> that is a great Mystery, and there is much Art and Prudence to be used therein: my Countrey-men on the other side of the Sea were many years, before they could arrive to that perfection and skill, which they now have above all other Nations. This I know, that some Excises they always take in kind, and Collect by Officers of the State; others they always Let to Farm: But if you will learn the right way, you need but send over some understanding man, who staying there but so long, as a Bill is usually passing in both Houses of Parliament, at his return will be able to teach you in an hour, that which did cost us many years experience, with much trouble and pains. So my good Yonker <hi>George,</hi> Adieu for this time, I must leave you.</p>

               <p>Farewell, honest <hi>Hans;</hi> I thank you for your good company, and shall be very glad that we may meet shortly again, and have further discourse of these Affairs.</p>
